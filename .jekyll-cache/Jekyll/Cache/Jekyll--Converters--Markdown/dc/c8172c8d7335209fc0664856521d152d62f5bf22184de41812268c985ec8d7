I"ü<p>T and B cells are the two cores of the adaptive immune system, and both express antigen-specific receptors at their surface, namely, T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs). The broad diversity of TCR and BCR ensures that the adaptive immune system is capable of recognizing a vast array of antigens, including pathogens, auto-antigens, allergens, and tumor neoantigens. Thus profiling and characterizing those antigen-specific receptors has become an important part of basic and clinical immunology research. We are interested in developing computational technologies to investigate the link between TCR/BCR sequence and epitope binding specificity, and to explore their potential for disease detection and monitoring the responses to therapy.</p>

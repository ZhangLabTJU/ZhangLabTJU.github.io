I"c<p>The concept of “omics” refers to the fact that all or nearly all instances of the targeted molecular space are measured in the assay, and therefore they provide holistic views of the biological system. The efficient processing and analysis of the omics data, especially extracting and discovering patterns from these data, has brought many challenges to bioinformatics and computational biology. As a computational biologist with a background in computer science, I’m particularly interested in developing and applying novel machine learning and data mining approaches to address these challenges.</p>
